# Camping Trip Planner
## by Ryan O'Connor, Sebastian Tota, Shravanth Surapaneni, Marcus Anestad and Matthew Day 

### Project Overview
_The goal of the project is to create an application for camping/outdoor trips. The project
functionality includes planning, responsibility sharing, and photo uploading. Users of the app
will be able to create a trip and invite friends. The focus of the planning section includes gear lists, 
food menus, directions, and maps. Responsibility sharing includes signing up for bringing food/gear, keeping track of 
how much each person spends, and a system for reimbursement after the trip. Finally, after the trip members can upload and 
make comments on photos._

### Vision Statement
_For a group of adventure seekers who are planning an outdoors activity together the Camping 
Trip Planner is a web app that allows groups to plan a trip together in a more intuitive and seamless 
way unlike Google Sheets which takes longer to create._

### Personas

#### Julia, a college student

_Julia, age 21, is a senior CS major at Temple University in Philadelphia. 
She grew up in Montgomery County, where she would enjoy hikes around the Wissahickon
with her family growing up. This extended to a true passion for outdoor activities and
does them to relax and escape the stresses of her daily life._

_With an increase in course difficulty on top of living in the age of COVID,
Julia relies heavily on weekly social distanced outings with her friends to
maintain her sanity. On a recent trip to the Poconos for some camping, her group
realized they forgot to bring anything substantial for dinner. Being out in the middle of
nowhere they had to drive 50 minutes to a supermarket to remedy the situation, cutting heavily
into their time with each other and nature. Being a person that is highly involved in the world of
new software technology, Julia wondered if there was an app that could help prevent an incident like
this in the future. Luckily, she stumbled across the Camping Trip Planner app. Since then,
every trip goes off without a hitch._

#### Juan, a father

_Juan is a parent of two. His family always looks forward to going on a yearly summer 
canoe trips with the Smithâ€™s. Juan is a doctor and pretty inexperienced when it comes 
to new technology. However he loves learning new things. He hears about Camping Trip 
Planner and excitedly calls Mr. Smith. They are easily able to set up profiles and 
create a trip._

_Now they are easily able to organize and plan the trip. They are also able to get 
their children (Smith, John, Smitty, and Johnny) involved and begin to teach them 
everything that goes into organizing such a trip. They have a great time and plan 
on using Camping Trip Planner for planning their trip next year._
